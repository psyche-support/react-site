    "body": "Over the past five years, I have been working as a mental health counselor through various mental health platforms. I hold a Master’s degree in Counselling Psychology from the University of Sheffield, where I also completed a one and a half year practicum, providing therapeutic sessions both in person and online. I am currently continuing my academic journey with undergraduate studies in Psychology, aiming to further deepen both the theoretical and practical foundations of my profession.\n\n        I hold a degree in Theology from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, which has contributed to a better understanding of human values, spiritual pursuits and existential concerns. This knowledge enriches my approach to psychology and my work, allowing me to support clients in a more holistic and integrated way.\n\n        Alongside my professional work, I have been actively involved in volunteering with organizations such as ENTOS#EKTOS, where I served as a facilitator and coordinator of creative workshops for vulnerable social groups and juvenile offenders. Through platforms such as It’s complicated, I offered free sessions to Ukrainians affected by the war. Additionally, as a volunteer at Milamou.gr, I provide support to people in need.\n\n        I work online in the field of mental health with individuals of all ages and diverse cultural backgrounds. At the same time, I invest consistently in my personal and professional growth through personal therapy, individual and group supervision, attending seminars, writing articles, and actively engaging in the wider mental health community."
