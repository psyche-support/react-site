Creating a safe, supportive environment where clients feel heard and genuinely connected allows them the space to explore, heal, and grow. My approach is inspired by Psychodynamic, Person-Centered, Existential, Gestalt, and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, and is adapted with respect to each person’s unique needs. Whether you are facing a present difficulty or wish to delve deeper into your inner experiences, therapy is a space to listen and reconnect with yourself.",
