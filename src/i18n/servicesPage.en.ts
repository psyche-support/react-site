Couples often experience phases of tension or disconnection, and sometimes repetitive patterns emerge that cause conflict or separation. Individual therapy focuses on understanding the deeper causes of these patterns and reactions, examining past experiences, beliefs, and emotional wounds that affect your ability to form strong and healthy bonds. Through individual therapy, you can learn to recognize your personal patterns, strengthen self-esteem, and develop strategies to navigate relationship challenges. This self-reflection helps you better understand your needs, improve communication with yourself, and ultimately create more satisfying and resilient relationships."
