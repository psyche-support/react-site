summary: Sexual abuse is an escalating social issue that has gained significant public attention, especially following recent reports from survivors. In just six months, the women’s helpline 15900 received more than 4,000 calls, with dozens of women forced to leave their homes for safety. This article draws a parallel between the myth of Medusa and sexual violence, exploring the roles of victim, perpetrator, and witness. In the myth, Poseidon rapes Medusa, while Athena punishes her, leaving the aggressor untouched. The allegory highlights how society often stigmatizes and blames victims, making disclosure harder. Listening to and supporting survivors is essential.

Sexual abuse is a growing social issue that has captured public attention, especially after recent disclosures by survivors. Within the broader context of violence against women, the helpline 15900 reported receiving over 4,000 calls in just six months; more than 50 women endured such severe violence that they fled their homes, often with children, to emergency shelters, according to the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.

This article explores how the myth of Medusa relates to sexual abuse, considering victims, perpetrators, and witnesses. In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Medusa is described as a strikingly beautiful woman whose appearance attracted Poseidon’s desire. He isolated and raped her within Athena’s sacred temple. When Athena discovered the violation, she stripped Medusa of her beauty, replacing her hair with snakes and cursing her to turn to stone anyone who met her gaze (Ovid, 1966).

The myth’s allegory echoes psychoanalytic ideas, such as Sandor Ferenczi’s view (1949) that every trauma involves three roles: victim, aggressor, and observer. When a witness remains silent or distorts the truth, the trauma deepens. In this story, Athena—witness and authority—blames the victim, punishing Medusa with isolation rather than holding the perpetrator accountable. The pain is silenced and only expressed through the petrified figures, symbols of unspoken suffering (Leys, 2010).

Meanwhile, Poseidon, the aggressor, remains unpunished. The parallel to modern reality is clear: victims of sexual assault are still censored and blamed, often questioned about their clothing, relationship to the perpetrator, or why they were alone at night. This secondary victimization reverses roles and discourages reporting, making justice harder to reach (Searles, 2019).

Listening to survivors without judgment, giving them space and time to share their stories, remains essential if we are to confront the silence and stigma surrounding sexual violence.
