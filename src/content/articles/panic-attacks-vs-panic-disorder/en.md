summary: Panic attacks and panic disorder share the element of “panic,” an intense, uncontrollable fear that disrupts clear thinking. While a single panic attack can occur suddenly, repeated episodes may develop into panic disorder. Panic attacks arise when the body’s “fight or flight” response activates without real danger, flooding the system with adrenaline and causing symptoms like dizziness, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, shaking, sweating, and fear of losing control. During an attack, reasoning is clouded, and reassurance is ineffective. Effective treatment often involves psychotherapy to address underlying causes, sometimes combined with medication, but therapy alone can offer deeper, lasting solutions.

Both terms “panic attack” and “panic disorder”, have in common the word “panic”. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), Panic is defined as an extreme and uncontrollable fear or anxiety that affects logical thinking by a perceived fear or threat. The difference between panic attack and panic disorder, is that repeated panic attacks can lead to a panic disorder (DSM). So, it is the number and intensity of panic attacks that can end up in a panic disorder. 
	
In order to better understand the way a panic attack manifests, it is important to explain how the human body reacts to a perceived threat. The human body has developed the “fight or flight” response in an attempt to manage life-threatening situations. Imagine that you stand in front of a bear. Your body will start to be flooded with chemicals such as adrenaline that triggers physiological  changes. The blood is shifted to the muscles to prepare for physical combat or running away. Thus, the blood is diverted away from non-essential regions like fingers, toes and brain. This causes dizziness and feelings of fainting. At the same time the blood flows faster, so the heart rate increases from 70 pulses per minute, and can reach 180 (rapid heartbeat). As a result the breathing pattern changes by becoming more rapid (Asnis, G. M., & Praag, H. M.,1995, Margraf, J., Taylor, C. B., Ehlers, A., Roth, W. T., & Agras, W. S., 1987). 
	
So basically, the panic attack is a "false alarm" that we are in danger and can occur, either due to external reasons such as stress, either due to internal reasons, e.g. thoughts, fantasies. It mainly includes symptoms of sweating, shaking, dizziness, fear and fear of losing control or death, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath etc. 

During the experience of a panic attack, there is no time or "clarity" for people to realize that they feel this way because they are breathing faster. By controlling the breathing pattern the physical symptoms can be reduced. Panic overshadows any thought, explanation or urge from someone else to calm down. Expressions "it's nothing, it will pass" or "you imagine it, it's your idea" are not helpful, because you do not imagine it but you live it and it is the way your body prepares you for an approaching danger (Baker, 2011).

Panic attacks are treated in most cases only with Individual Psychotherapy without medication, or in other cases, with psychotherapy and medication. Taking only medication that may be recommended in some cases, but without receiving psychotherapy at the same time, has the cost of losing the chance to explore the root of the problem. The drug only suppresses the symptom and not the cause. Psychotherapy, on the other hand, focuses on the cause of the panic attack and this will eventually be the beginning of the solution to the problem.
