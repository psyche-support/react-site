summary: The myth of freedom in love is challenged, as partner choices are often not truly free. People tend to repeat relationship patterns, gravitating toward partners with similar traits, even when those traits have proven unsuitable. This is linked to the idea of ‘repetitive compulsion,’ where we unconsciously seek familiar emotions and situations to ‘fix’ old wounds. The familiar feels safe, while the unknown can be frightening. Our relationships are shaped by early experiences with parents or caregivers, influencing how we connect with others. Recognizing these patterns and working through them in therapy helps achieve genuine freedom of choice.

The myth of love is the belief that we are free to love whomever we wish. The question that arises in this article is to what extent we are truly free in choosing a romantic partner.

The criteria by which people choose whom they will fall in love with are much darker and more complex than one might believe. In other words, here we are referring to “relationship patterns,” according to which the dominant feeling is that someone becomes involved again and again in relationships with different people, yet there seems to be a repetition in behaviors and dynamics. How many of you have wondered whether your former partners have many things in common? Why do we chase the same type of person even when it has been proven unsuitable for us? This can happen in romantic, friendly, or professional relationships. Thus, relationship patterns involve the repetition of the same behaviors with new people who enter our lives (Park, Y., & MacDonald, 2019; Rauer, Pettit, Lansford, Bates, & Dodge, 2013).

According to the theory of repetition compulsion, we seek relationships that disappointed us in the past, attempting to change them, to correct them. It is like rewriting the same story with the hope of a different ending. People unconsciously choose unsuitable partners; it is a “blind spot” dominated by the desire for unfulfilled emotional needs, which finds resonance in the sense of the “familiar.” Very often, people do not seek what is best for them, but what is familiar, because the familiar feels “safe” while the unknown is frightening (Freud, 1914).

The relationships we form with others are based on the relationships we had with parents or caregivers when we were children. From there arises the way we relate to others (Park, Y., & MacDonald, 2019). Recognizing these patterns is the first step to addressing them and to gaining the “freedom” to choose whom we will love. The appropriate therapeutic relationship can serve as an opportunity to explore childhood experiences and the ways in which these experiences influence present life.
