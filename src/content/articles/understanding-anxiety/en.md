summary: Anxiety is a psychological state triggered by real or perceived situations, often marked by fear, stress, loss of control, and physical symptoms like sweating, dizziness, trembling, and rapid heartbeat. While mild stress can motivate and improve performance, excessive or uncontrolled stress harms mood, health, and relationships. Anxiety activates the “fight or flight” response, preparing the body to face danger. Many attribute anxiety to external factors—work, finances, studies—seeing themselves as victims. However, anxiety often arises from our perceptions and interpretations, not events themselves. By understanding this, we can reshape thoughts, gain control, reduce stress, and adopt healthier coping behaviors.

As a definition of anxiety, we can consider a psychological state or reaction to a specific situation of an individual’s life. Anxiety is feeling fear, intense stress, lack of control, difficulties concentrating and it includes physical symptoms such as sweating, feeling restless, dizzy, numb, nausea, and having a rapid heart beat, trembling.

Anxiety is a common feeling people have when they are under high-pressure feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope. Up to point stress is considered healthy and good for people because through it they can be motivated to achieve some of their goals. But when they experience intense stress, especially when it feels out of control. It can negatively affect their mood, physical and mental well-being and relationships.  

The primary role of anxiety is to protect humans from danger more specifically when a person perceives a possible danger. The flight or flight response is activated in which the organism prepares for the possible fight or flight from the impending danger. During this reaction, we can observe the effects of anxiety on our body.

When people are anxious, it is due to a stimulus that causes them a feeling of helplessness, an insecurity about what might happen and fear. 

In the question: what stresses you every day, most of us are likely to look for the causes in external factors perceiving them as the main reasons for the development of the feelings of anxiety, fear and worry. For example, one might claim that it is their job that stresses them, another person could say that financial matters evoke feelings of stress, or an academic obligation appears to be stressful for another person. What is the common theme for the above statements? The above statements give the person a passive role in the face of stress by implying that a person is a victim of external factors. By giving ourselves zero or minimal responsibility for what happens in our lives, we can lead ourselves to low efforts towards change, since there is the impression that the improvement of emotional state requires change of external factors. Thus, there is the conclusion that an external situation creates our anxiety.

However, by taking a step back and analyzing the process that connects the situation with our emotional response, we are very likely to identify an element that mediates this relationship. In most cases what causes our feelings and reactions is not the situation, other people or external phenomena, but the way in which we perceive and interpret them. It is how we see something, the thoughts and beliefs we develop about the situation that determines how we feel and react.

By understanding and accepting the nature of the situation, we can develop a more functional, realistic and helpful perception of reality, which can lead to more functional forms of behaviors and lower intensity of negative emotions.
