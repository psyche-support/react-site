summary: The feeling of injustice triggers negative emotions and can influence future decisions. In the workplace, people often express anger not only toward those who wronged them but also toward unrelated colleagues, creating a vicious cycle known as ‘generalized negative reciprocity.’ Research by Professor Bernd Weber showed that employees mistreated by superiors tend to pass that unfairness down to subordinates. In the ‘Dictator Game,’ 83% distributed money unequally. Writing a letter to express anger proved to be the most effective way to break this cycle, while short pauses or neutral thoughts were less helpful.

The sense of injustice often triggers powerful negative emotional responses and can influence the way we make decisions later on. In the workplace, people who feel unfairly treated often express their anger not only toward those directly responsible but also toward colleagues who are not at fault. This creates a chain reaction, where the wronged adopt the behavior of those who wronged them. This phenomenon is known as “generalized negative reciprocity.”

According to Professor Bernd Weber of Boston University, employees who experience unfair treatment from employers tend to reproduce it toward subordinates. This dynamic was explored in a behavioral experiment known as the “Dictator Game.” In this study, 237 participants assumed the role of a dictator and were asked to decide whether to distribute a sum of money equally among team members or to keep most or all of it for themselves. The team members were passive recipients—they had no choice but to accept the dictator’s decision, hence the name. The results were striking: 83% of participants chose an unequal distribution, while the group members accepted the decision despite the emotional strain.

Researchers concluded that those who felt wronged often adopted similar behavior themselves as a coping mechanism. They then investigated how this destructive cycle might be broken and tested three scenarios. In the first, a brief pause of three minutes allowed for some emotional detachment. In the second, participants were asked to think of a neutral image to distract themselves. In the third, they were invited to write a letter to the dictator expressing their dissatisfaction. The third scenario proved the most effective—those who wrote letters were more likely to behave fairly toward others afterward. Since negative emotions stemmed from feeling wronged, effectively processing and regulating those feelings reduced generalized negative reciprocity.

In summary, when someone experiences injustice and develops feelings of anger or frustration, finding a way to express those emotions is liberating. It creates space to assess the situation more objectively and prevents passing the unfairness on to others.
