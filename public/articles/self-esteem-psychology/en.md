summary: "Self-esteem describes how we evaluate our personal worth and whether we feel we are deserving. It is subjective and may differ from reality: sometimes we underestimate ourselves, other times we overestimate. It develops from an early age, increases during adolescence, peaks around ages 50–60, and declines in older age. Low self-esteem leads to doubt, lack of assertiveness, and settling for less, creating a vicious cycle. It is linked to a lack of self-awareness. Psychotherapy helps identify the causes, accept oneself, and set new goals. Living the life we deserve is a right and can be achieved through change and effort."

The term “self-esteem” in psychology is used to describe a person’s subjective perception of their own worth. Simply put, it reflects how much someone values or is satisfied with themselves, whether they believe they are worthy, and how they form positive or negative judgments about themselves.

Because self-esteem is based on subjectivity, it does not always align with reality. At times, we may underestimate our abilities and ourselves, while at other times we may overestimate them.

The way we evaluate ourselves begins at an early age. Research shows that self-esteem tends to rise during adolescence into mid-adulthood, peak around the ages of 50–60, and decline in older age. Studies have examined the course of self-esteem during critical developmental stages, such as adolescence and old age.

People with low self-esteem struggle to see their strengths and abilities, leading them to believe they are unworthy. As a result, they do not try or demand more for themselves, settling for less. This creates a cycle: the person believes they deserve little, they make no effort, and eventually confirm to themselves that they cannot achieve or deserve better.

A lack of self-awareness is one reason for low self-esteem. This means that by observing ourselves, we can learn who we are and who we can become. This process is ongoing; it never stops and is more like continuous practice. It is important not to neglect our weaknesses, but also not to focus only on our strengths. Both strengths and weaknesses make up the whole of who we are.

How we feel about ourselves affects our thoughts, emotions, behavior, relationships with others, and our own self-image. The differences between high and low self-esteem are clear: in the latter, individuals judge themselves harshly, rely more on others’ opinions, avoid taking responsibility and initiatives, and do not assert themselves. High self-esteem, on the other hand, involves accepting and acknowledging failures and aiming for self-improvement.

Psychotherapy provides the opportunity to identify the sources of low self-esteem, move toward self-acceptance, set new goals, and reassess one’s value. We have the right to live a life that reflects our worth, and if this is not happening, it is in our power to change it.
